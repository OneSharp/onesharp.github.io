# Poems

## The Tiger -- Nael

> The tiger  
> He destroyed his cage  
> Yes  
> YES  
> The tiger is out  

## Two Headed-Calf -- Laura Gilpin

> Tomorrow when the farm boys find this  
> freak of nature, they will wrap his body  
> in newspaper and carry him to the museum.  
>
>
> But tonight he is alive and in the north  
> field with his mother. It is a perfect  
> summer evening: the moon rising over  
> the orchard, the wind in the grass. And  
> as he stares into the sky, there are  
> twice as many stars as usual.  

## The Orange -- Wendy Cope

> At lunchtime I bought a huge orange—  
>The size of it made us all laugh.  
>I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave—  
>They got quarters and I had a half.  
>
>And that orange, it made me so happy,  
>As ordinary things often do  
>Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.  
>This is peace and contentment. It’s new.  
>
>The rest of the day was quite easy.  
>I did all the jobs on my list  
>And enjoyed them and had some time over.  
>I love you. I’m glad I exist.
