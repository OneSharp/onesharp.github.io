description: A list of things I want to learn about.
---

This post compiles a list of things I want to learn along with some concrete technical things to read and try.
It ranges from whole topics to concrete questions.
The hope is that I will regularly update this list with the topics I stumble upon.
If you have any suggestion on how to learn any of these topics please let me know!

# Topics

This is a list of vague topics that seem interesting.
I haven't really researched any of these or what their prerequisites are.

- Main arguments in favor/against compatibilism
- Computable analysis
- Distributed Algorithms
- Game theory and Algorithmic game theory
- Model theory
- Natural language processing
- Persistent homology
- POMDPs as a model of rational agents
- Stochastic scheduling

# Concrete things to read and try

This is a list of concrete papers, technical books, libraries and reading lists I want to dive into at some point.

- Animal Cognition: Evolution, Behavior and Cognition
- Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference
- [Bayesian persuasion](http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/emir.kamenica/documents/bayesianPersuasion.pdf)
- Haskell's [dimensional](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dimensional)
- Haskell's [lenses](https://leanpub.com/lenses)
- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/)
- [Radically Elementary Probability Theory](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~nelson/books/rept.pdf)
- [Philosophy of science](https://codual.github.io/2016/09/18/filosofia-de-la-ciencia/)
- [Physics for mathematicians](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/6047)
- Programming in Rust. [Learning Rust](https://learning-rust.github.io/)
- [Pseudorandomness](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~salil/pseudorandomness/)
- Purely Functional Data Structures
- [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/index.html)
- [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)

# Concrete questions

This is a list of concrete questions or clusters of related questions about a single specific topic.
The questions might not be well-defined

- How can one define a measure space on an arbitrary manifold? 
  Is it related to the concept of [pushforward measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure)?
  When the Radon-Nykodim derivative exists, what is it's relation with the manifold atlas?
- Given that 64.9% of philosophers surveyed [here](https://pinboard.in/u:mx_psi/b:6cc8789e74db) support the analyticâ€“synthetic distinction, what are the remaining 
  strongest arguments against logical positivism? If there are insurmountable hurdles to maintain logical positivism 
  as a coherent theory, what are its strongest successors?
