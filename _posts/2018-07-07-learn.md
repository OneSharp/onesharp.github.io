*******

This post compiles a list of things I want to learn along with some concrete technical things to read and try.
It ranges from whole topics to concrete questions.
The hope is that I will regularly update this list with the topics I stumble upon.
If you have any suggestion on how to learn any of these topics please let me know!

# Topics

This is a list of vague topics that seem interesting.
I haven't really researched any of these or what their prerequisites are.

- Main arguments in favor/against compatibilism
- Computable analysis
- Distributed Algorithms
- Game theory and Algorithmic game theory
- Model theory
- Natural language processing
- Persistent homology
- POMDPs as a model of rational agents
- Stochastic scheduling
- Fully homomorphic encryption schemes
- 20th century world history
- Structural equation modeling
- Item Response Theory
- Unification algorithms

# Concrete questions

This is a list of concrete questions or clusters of related questions about a single specific topic.
The questions might not be well-defined

- How can one define a measure space on an arbitrary manifold?
  Is it related to the concept of [pushforward measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure)?
  When the Radon-Nykodim derivative exists, what is it's relation with the manifold atlas?
- Given that 64.9% of philosophers surveyed [here](https://pinboard.in/u:mx_psi/b:6cc8789e74db) support the analyticâ€“synthetic distinction, what are the remaining
  strongest arguments against logical positivism? If there are insurmountable hurdles to maintain logical positivism 
  as a coherent theory, what are its strongest successors?
- In computational complexity theory, why are oracle separations sometimes provided as evidence of unrelativized results?
- What is, intuitively, a topos?
- How can I interpret elasticity in economics?
