Posts:

- [Decades-Old Computer Science Conjecture Solved in Two Pages](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-solves-computer-science-conjecture-in-two-pages-20190725/), on the sensitivity conjecture. I think Quanta magazine articles are sometimes inaccurate or misleading, but I really liked this one.
- [Why is Stack Overflow trying to start audio?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/331960/why-is-stack-overflow-trying-to-start-audio), on the nightmarish world of online advertising we live in.

- [Can ads on a page read my password?](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/214784/can-ads-on-a-page-read-my-password), in hindsight this is obvious but I hadn't thought about it.
- [Diff Strategies](https://neil.fraser.name/writing/diff/), on how to implement `diff`.
- [How a 'NULL' License Plate Landed One Hacker in Ticket Hell](https://www.wired.com/story/null-license-plate-landed-one-hacker-ticket-hell/)

Projects:

- I created some backup scripts and hooks and posted them [on Github](https://github.com/mx-psi/dotfiles). In particular:
   1. An extremely simple [hook for `yapf`](https://github.com/mx-psi/dotfiles/blob/master/hooks/yapf-hook.py),
   2. [a script](https://github.com/mx-psi/dotfiles/blob/master/backups/nextcloud-backup.py) for making full backups for my NextCloud calendar and
   3. [a script](https://github.com/mx-psi/dotfiles/blob/master/backups/pocket-backup.py) for auto-adding posts that I mark as favourite to the current month log.
   I'm writing a post to briefly explain how they work.
- [Una presentación](https://twitter.com/mx_psi/status/1165553878848462848) sobre si Valerie Solanas bebió agua.
