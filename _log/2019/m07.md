Books:

- *A Tour of C++*. I learned C++03 at university and although I had used C++11/14 features before, I had never stopped to actually learn about it systematically. This book made me think that C++11 is actually an acceptable language.
- *Effective Modern C++*. After reading the previous book I decided to keep on reading on some issues in this second book. This book then made me return to my original stance: C++ design is unbelievably complicated and it is close to impossible to have a mental model of its semantics or what a program will actually do in detail. I think some of the problems will be somewhat improved when concepts become *an official thing*, but nonetheless the list of exceptions and quirks surpasses by *a lot* those that I have found in other languages.
- *Locke & Key, vol. 1*. An adventure/fantasy/horror comic that I really enjoyed.

Videos & TV shows:

- [Men. Abuse. Trauma. - Philosophy Tube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeGEv0YVLtw), an excellent monologue on abuse. Content warning for discussions of (mostly psychological) abuse.
- *Fleabag*, seasons 1 & 2. Never had I fallen in love with a TV show so much as I have with this one. The use of the aside glance and private comments to the viewer is simply the best I had ever seen.
- *Big Little Lies*, season 2. I think I liked more the first season, but I was happy with it overall.
- *Chernobyl*, season 1. Although it seems it is historically inaccurate in some ways (apart from the plot devices), it is aesthetically superb.

En español:

- [Prohibido criticar al rey](https://asihablociceron.blogspot.com/2019/07/prohibido-criticar-al-rey.html), sobre la reciente decisión del Tribunal Constitucional de dejar sin efectos una resolución republicana del Parlament catalán, su sinsentido jurídico y sus implicaciones en la libertad de expresión.
- [Papers y más papers: las sombras en la industria de las publicaciones científicas](https://www.elsaltodiario.com/universidad/papers-y-mas-papers-las-sombras-en-la-industria-de-las-publicaciones-cientificas), sobre la publicación masiva de papers de baja calidad por los malos incentivos en investigación y otros problemas del panorama investigador español.
