Posts:

- [Quining Qualia](http://cogprints.org/254/1/quinqual.htm), a classic on eliminative materialism. I tried to read it a few years ago and I gave up, but rereading it now I think it is a must-read in philosophy of consciousness.
- [Hard Problems in Cryptocurrency: Five Years Later](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/11/22/progress.html). I'm not a big fan of cryptocurrencies although I think some of the technologies have some potential for being used to solve coordination problems. The underlying issues are very interesting though, and this article summarizes some of them.
- [T E X T F I L E S](http://www.textfiles.com/directory.html), a collection of text files from the 90s.
- [Donkey vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_vote), a surprising phenomena of compulsory preferential voting systems.
- [Partition the HTTP Cache](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5730772021411840), major browsers are splitting the HTTP cache per origin. This apparently does not have a significant hit on performance (maybe because most people use only a handful of websites most of the time?), and [the kinds of attacks it prevents](https://terjanq.github.io/Bug-Bounty/Google/cache-attack-06jd2d2mz2r0/index.html) are very interesting.

- [Why you might be counting in the wrong language](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191121-why-you-might-be-counting-in-the-wrong-language), the Sappir-Whorf hypothesis applied to numbers. It's interesting, but I am skeptical about it and the results are probably overblown.

- [The SQL Murder Mistery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/), a cute puzzle to learn SQL.

Videos:

- [The Creativity Delusion: Geniuses Steal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB1KE5dbOZo), a video with awesome imagery on how geniuses literally steal and why that is good.
- [The Trouble with the Video Game Industry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYkLVU5UGM8), marxism and videogames.

Podcasts:

- [Politics and More: Samantha's Journey into the Alt-Right, and Back](http://www.wnyc.org/story/samanthas-journey-alt-right-and-back-pm/), I was skeptical when I first saw the podcast and I thought it would be a different story, but it is more realistic than I thought.

En español:

- [La sentencia de la Arandina](http://asihablociceron.blogspot.com/2019/12/la-sentencia-de-la-arandina.html), análisis legal de la sentencia de la Arandina.
