Posts:

- [Build Systems à la Carte](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems-final.pdf), a classification of build systems and their capabilities, with an associated Haskell library. It's cute to see spreadsheet software as a build system.
- [What Happens Next Will Amaze You](https://idlewords.com/talks/what_happens_next_will_amaze_you.htm), a transcript on a talk on how to fix the digital surveillance nightmare. See also [The Website Obesity Crisis](https://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm).
- [One Man’s Modus Ponens](https://www.gwern.net/Modus), an explanation of the saying ‘One man’s modus ponens is another man’s modus tollens’.
- [Why is printf better than echo?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/65819/122262), on why `echo` is considered (mildly) harmful.
- [The Making of Youtube Radical](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html), an example of far-right radicalization boosted by Youtube's recommendation algorithm.
- [FBI agent accidentally reveals own 8chan posts; attempts to redirect white supremacist rage against Russia](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/c1nnsn/fbi_agent_accidentally_reveals_own_8chan_posts/erehxrq), on the strategies used by the FBI on white supremacist's forums to steer their interests away from the FBI/CIA/Mossad and towards Russian intelligence agencies.
- [Questions For Our Opponents, Answered](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2019/06/24/questions-for-our-opponents-answered/), where Ozy answers questions from a TERF. I don't usually like this kinds of posts (I think most of the time these kinds of questions are not intended to spark a fruitful conversation but rather they are wielded as a propagandistic 'weapon') but I think this is genuinely informative if you have nver understood trans issues.
- [What The Hell Is Going On With UFOs And The Department Of Defense?](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/27666/what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-ufos-and-department-of-defense), on how the United States' DoD might be promoting the UFO myth to distract people from classified experiments with advanced hardware. Big caveat here about this being *very* speculative.
- [Let It Bleed: Libertarianism and the Workplace](http://crookedtimber.org/2012/07/01/let-it-bleed-libertarianism-and-the-workplace/), on the nightmare the US is for workers' rights, and on how libertarians contradict themselves when speaking about coertion in the workplace.


Videos and TV shows:

- *Twin Peaks* seasons 1 & 2, a fascinating 90s classic.

Videogames and board games:

- *Azul*, 2018's "Game of The Year". A beautiful-looking competitive puzzle game.

Podcasts:

- [#144 Dark Pattern - Reply All](https://podcasts.nu/avsnitt/reply-all/144-dark-pattern), a podcast on TurboTax's deceptive schemes for hiding its free version.

Projects:

- I finished my bachelor's thesis, entitled ["Quantum computation models"](https://github.com/mx-psi/tfg/blob/master/tfg.pdf), on quantum complexity theory and concrete quantum algorithms. I am sure there is plenty of errata or omissions lying around, but overall I am quite satisfied with the result. I wish I had had time to rewrite some of it using a more categorical language, maybe I will do so at some point. Constructive criticism is welcome.

- Di una charla (otra más) sobre [algoritmos cuánticos en Quipper](https://mx-psi.github.io/quantum-algorithms) en [esLibre](https://eslib.re/2019/).
