### TV Show, movies & documentaries

- *La Comunidad*. A rewatch of one of my favorite Spanish movies.
- *Greener Grass*. It could have been fun if it was like, 20 minutes instead of 95.
- *The Shivering Truth*. It's… interesting?
- *Better Call Saul* (season 4 & season 5). People didn't like the first season of the show as much as I do, but I think it's worth re-watching.

### Books

- [Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3545216493). A good book to read if you live in the US or like neoliberalism, maybe not so much otherwise.

### Computer Science

No math stuff on this edition :( I am slowly going through Gelman's *Bayesian Data Analysis* and Judea Pearl's *The Book of Why* but I am having trouble to find the time to read :(

### Science & economics

- [Ontology Of Psychiatric Conditions: Taxometrics](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ontology-of-psychiatric-conditions), Scott Alexander is back to talk about the classification of mental ilness. My inner logical positivist doesn't love the framing of *is mental ilness a thing* but the article is pretty good.

- [The limits of egg recognition: testing acceptance thresholds of American robins in response to decreasingly egg-shaped objects in the nest](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201615). I will never stop being fascinated by "treating animals as neural networks" studies.
- [A lunar pandemic](https://aeon.co/essays/what-can-we-learn-from-the-lunar-pandemic-that-never-was), when people worried about a pandemic coming from the Apollo missions.

I don't love [Scott's reply](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/statement-on-new-york-times-article) nor [Matthew Yglesias' one](https://www.slowboring.com/p/slate-star-codex) (I don't think they address the most important stuff that is raised on the NYT article) but I think they give important context on some of the NYT claims.
