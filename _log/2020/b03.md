### Projects

- I published `fa-scrapper` as a [pip package](https://pypi.org/project/fa-scrapper/#description).
- Spent quite some time installing Kodi on a Raspberry Pi without a keyboard until I figured out it has a screen keyboard you can use from the very beginning :clown:
- Mostly focused on getting used to work so not much more but I have some public projects in mind to maybe do for the next two months (!) (no hard promises)

### Videos & Podcasts

- [Cringe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRBsaJPkt2Q), by Contrapoints. A bit too long but it's definitely worth it.
- [The Scaredy Cats Horror Show](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/scaredy-cats), a five episode podcast show about horror films which includes awesome discussions on some of my favorite films of the last few years like Midsommar and Get Out.
- [#80 - Professor Stuart Russell on why our approach to AI is broken and how to fix it](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/stuart-russell-human-compatible-ai/), interesting although a bit hand-wavey, but I haven't read the HCAI book yet.
- [RESET - Recode Daily - Tear Gas, explained](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9yc3MuYXJ0MTkuY29tL3Jlc2V0/episode/ZDUwNTE5MzYtNDg2MC0xMWVhLWE4OTMtMWY4ZjM0Yjk2YWY2), on the famous chemical which is banned at war but used against protestors all over the world.

### TV Shows, movies & documentaries

I think I have never posted this here, but you can see all films I have watched since 2017 [here](https://letterboxd.com/mx_psi/films/diary/). New films that I really liked in these past two months are:

- _But I'm a Cheerleader_
- _O Auto da Compadecida_
- _¡Vampiros en La Habana!_

### Math & Computer Science

- ["The Chromium project finds that around 70% of our serious security bugs are memory safety problems."](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety)
- [Presentation on Purely Functional Data Structures](https://doisinkidney.com/posts/2020-05-19-purely-functional-data-structures-slides.html),
- [A brief overview on how do Vocoders work](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/227152/108444)
- [Compiler Compiler: A Twitch series about working on a JavaScript engine](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/06/compiler-compiler-working-on-a-javascript-engine/) this is quite cool!

### Science & Economics

- [What Does Any of This Have To Do with Physics?](http://nautil.us/issue/43/heroes/what-does-any-of-this-have-to-do-with-physics), at some point in my life I really wanted to be in academia and I became disillusioned with it because of all the demoralizing stats and disheartening stories. This is one of those stories.
- [Relevant pre-AGI possibilities](https://aiimpacts.org/relevant-pre-agi-possibilities/), a fun speculative list of relevant technological and social changes for AGI
- [Facebook Novi & Surveillance Finance](https://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/novi.html)

- [Fuck the Bread. The Bread Is Over.](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2020/05/07/fuck-the-bread-the-bread-is-over/)
- [Little Soldiers – Inside the Chinese Education System](https://dormin.org/2020/01/23/little-soldiers-inside-the-chinese-education-system/)
- [Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish the Police](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/sunday/floyd-abolish-defund-police.html). I get a little tired about some debates on reform v. abolition (imo many of them boil down to irrelevant semantics issues) when it comes to police and prisons so I am sometimes hesitant to call myself an abolitionist but this is an article I think I could fully endorse.
- [Hack Brief: Anonymous Stole and Leaked a Megatrove of Police Documents](https://www.wired.com/story/blueleaks-anonymous-law-enforcement-hack/)

- I learned [prison farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_farm) are a thing in the USA in 2020, jeez.
