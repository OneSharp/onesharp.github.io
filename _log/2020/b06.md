### Films & books

- [Fateful Findings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fateful_Findings) by Neil Breen is one of the worst movies (if not the worst) that I have ever watched. It is impressive how someone can do such a bad job at making a movie.
- [Borat Subsequent Moviefilm](https://letterboxd.com/film/borat-subsequent-moviefilm/). It never ceases to amaze me how can someone believe such an over-the-top parody of antisemitism and general conspiratorial beliefs but well, it's 2020 I guess. The Rudy Giuliani scene was… something. Content warning for racism, antisemitism, conspiracy theories.
- [House](https://letterboxd.com/film/house/), the OST is brilliant.
- *Succession*, seasons 1 & 2.
- [Exhalation: Stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41160292) by Ted Chiang. 


### Math & Computer Science

- [How Flash games shaped the video game industry](https://flashgamehistory.com), Flash nostalgia done right.
- The *Exotic Programming Ideas* series by Stephen Diehl is great, see in particular [Part 2 (Term Rewriting)](https://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/exotic02.html) and [Part 3 (Effect Systems)](https://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/exotic03.html).
- [Cross-site leaks wiki](https://xsleaks.dev/) on side-channel attacks on privacy and security on modern browsers.

- [Improving DNS Privacy with Oblivious DoH in 1.1.1.1](https://blog.cloudflare.com/oblivious-dns/). I hope Firefox ends up using this internally, it would allay some (justified) privacy fears by users.
- [Shuffling things up: Applying Group Theory in Advent of Code](https://blog.jle.im/entry/shuffling-things-up.html): a fun article on applying some (very simple) group theory to solve shuffling problems.

- [No, Productivity Does Not Explain Income](https://economicsfromthetopdown.com/2019/07/08/no-productivity-does-not-explain-income/). I don't love the tone of the article but the idea of comparing Gini indices is very cool.
- [Property Is Only Another Name for Monopoly](https://academic.oup.com/jla/article/9/1/51/3572441). I think this would be awesome for at least certain kinds of property even if applying it to personal property sounds like a terrible idea.
- [The Priority Heuristic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2891015/): a simple process model for how humans actually decide.
